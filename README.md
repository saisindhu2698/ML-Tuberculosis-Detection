## üìå Project Overview

Tuberculosis (TB) is a life-threatening bacterial infection primarily affecting the lungs. According to WHO reports, over 1.2 million people die from TB annually, with a significant number of cases occurring in South-East Asia. Early detection is crucial for timely medical intervention and improving survival rates.

This project employs machine learning models to classify lung X-ray images as **TB-positive** or **TB-negative** using supervised learning algorithms. The dataset comprises **155 chest X-ray images**, preprocessed and analyzed to enhance diagnostic accuracy.

## üè• Introduction

The rapid growth of biomedical data presents opportunities for leveraging **machine learning (ML)** in healthcare applications. Medical data mining allows for the extraction of critical insights, assisting healthcare professionals in diagnosing diseases like TB.

**Challenges in TB detection:**
- Variability in X-ray images makes manual diagnosis difficult.
- High false-positive and false-negative rates in traditional screening methods.
- Need for automated, AI-driven diagnostic tools for rapid assessment.

This project applies **ML classification techniques** to overcome these challenges, comparing multiple algorithms to determine the most effective approach.

## üìä Model Training

The following **machine learning classifiers** were implemented:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Local K-Nearest Neighbors (Local KNN)
- A lazy learning algorithm that classifies data points based on the majority vote of their nearest neighbors.
- The model determines the **optimal value of K** through experimentation.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Distance Weighted K-Nearest Neighbors (DW-KNN)
- A variation of KNN that assigns **higher weights to closer neighbors** to improve accuracy.
- Reduces misclassification by emphasizing nearby data points.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Gradient Boosting Classifier
- An ensemble learning method that builds models sequentially, correcting previous errors.
- Fine-tuned using various **learning rates** for optimal performance.

**Cross-validation** was used to ensure robustness in model evaluation.

**Performance Metrics Used:**
- **Accuracy:** Measures the overall correctness of the model.
- **Precision & Recall:** Evaluates false positives and false negatives.
- **F1-score:** Balances precision and recall for a more comprehensive assessment.

| Model                | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-score |
|----------------------|---------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Local KNN           | 67%     | 0.70      | 0.67   | 0.66     |
| Weighted KNN        | 69%     | 0.79      | 0.73   | 0.72     |
| Gradient Boosting   | **73.8%**  | -         | -      | -        |
